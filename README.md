# NS-SMC
Code and results for Spike-and-Slab (Phase Transition) experiment in "Unbiased and Consistent Nested Sampling via Sequential Monte Carlo" by Salomone et al., (2023). Running `run_all.m` will replicate all the results stored in the `.mat` files, and `makeLatexResults.m` will output the results in the form of Latex code for the table as seen in the paper. 

See the main repo (hosted by Leah South) for all code for the paper [here](https://github.com/LeahPrice/SMC-NS).
